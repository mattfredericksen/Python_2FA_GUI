# SecureLogin
A UNT course project for CSCE 3550 (Computer Security). Completed on 07/14/2020.

### Project Details
For a thorough description of the purpose, methodology, and results of this project, please see the [Project Report](Project%20Report.pdf).  
  
Briefly, the purpose was to demonstrate knowledge of and gain experience with implementing basic data security principles (mostly confidentiality, rather than integrity or availability). This was achieved through creating a "login interface," an application that allows a user to create and sign into an account using SMS two-factor authentication. More information about which security principles and technologies were used can be found on page 4 of the [Project Report](Project%20Report.pdf).

### Setup
1. Download all project files.
2. Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html) with Python 3.7.8.
   - The application was tested with 3.7.1 and 3.7.8. Other versions are untested.
3. Activate the virtual environment.
4. Run `pip install -r requirements/<OS>.txt`, where `<OS>` is either `windows` or `linux`.
5. Run `python secure_login.py`.

### Demonstration
Screenshots and text descriptions can be found on page 6 of the [Project Report](Project%20Report.pdf). This 6-minute [video demonstration](https://youtu.be/lilM6lorRwQ) should be available on YouTube.
